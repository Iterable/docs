                Your Submission. You must agree to the terms of this
                Agreement before making a Submission to any Project.
                This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You,
                now or in the future (except as described in Section 4
                below), Submit to any Project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Originality of Work. You represent that each of Your
                Submissions is entirely Your original work. Should You
                wish to Submit materials that are not Your original
                work, You may Submit them separately to the Project if
                (a) You retain all copyright and license information
                that was in the materials as You received them, (b) in
                the description accompanying Your Submission, You
                include the phrase “Submission containing materials of a
                third party:” followed by the names of the third party
                and any licenses or other restrictions of which You are
                aware, and (c) You follow any other instructions in the
                Project’s written guidelines concerning Submissions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your Employer. References to “employer” in this
                Agreement include Your employer or anyone else for whom
                You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a
                contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your Submission is made
                in the course of Your work for an employer or Your
                employer has intellectual property rights in Your
                Submission by contract or applicable law, You must
                secure permission from Your employer to make the
                Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case,
                the term “You” in this Agreement will refer to You and
                the employer collectively. If You change employers in
                the future and desire to Submit additional Submissions
                for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new
                Agreement and secure permission from the new employer
                before Submitting those Submissions.

                    Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
                    sell and import or otherwise dispose of the

                    additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including,
                    without limitation, any implied licenses) are

                Representations and Warranties. You represent that You
                are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You
                represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your
                original work (except as You may have disclosed as
                required pursuant to Section 3). You represent that You
                have secured permission from Your employer to make the
                Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the
                course of Your work for Your employer or Your employer
                has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by
                contract or applicable law. If You are signing this
                Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and
                warrant that You have the necessary authority to bind
                the listed employer to the obligations contained in this
                Agreement. You are not expected to provide support for
                Your Submission, unless You choose to do so. UNLESS
                REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND
                EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS
                3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS
                AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

                Notice to mParticle. You agree to notify mParticle in
                writing of any facts or circumstances of which You later
                become aware that would make any of Your representations
                in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Information about Submissions. You agree that
                contributions to Projects and information about
                contributions may be maintained indefinitely and
                disclosed publicly, including Your name and other
                information that You Submit with Your Submission.
            </li>
            <li>
                Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
                exclusively by the internal laws of the State of New
                York, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. The
                state and federal courts located in the State of New

                connection with any action or litigation in any way
                arising out of or related to this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Entire Agreement/Assignment. This Agreement is the
                entire agreement between the parties regarding Your
                Submission of any materials to any Project, and
